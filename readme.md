## 🎨 Design Considerations
- **Why is darker red lower income? Shouldn't darker colors represent more of a phenomenon?**
    - I felt that darker red to represent lower income was more appropriate, as it feels reminiscent of historical redlining maps, with redlining, and similar historical discrimination, being one of the major factors in creating the spatial patterns of income we see today.
